Freescale STM timer used as clockevents

This STM timer driver is designed to be used as clockevents
for S32 SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible : "fsl,s32v234-stm", "fsl,s32gen1-stm"
- reg : Should contain 1 register range(address and length)
- interrupts : One interrupt for STM timer
- cpu: The virtual cpu id which will use the timer as
	clockevents generator.

Optional properties:
- clocks : stm clock
- clock-names : stm

Example 1:

#include <dt-bindings/clock/s32gen1-scmi-clock.h>

stm0: stm@4011C000 {
	compatible = "fsl,s32gen1-stm";
	reg = <0x4011C000 0x3000>;
	interrupts= <0 24 4>;
	clocks = <&clks S32GEN1_SCMI_CLK_STM_MODULE>;
	clock-names = "stm";
	cpu = <2>;
};

Example 2:

#include <dt-bindings/clock/s32v234-clock.h>

stm1: stm@4000D000{
	compatible = "fsl,s32v234-stm";
	reg = <0x4000D000 0x1000>;
	interrupts= <0 19 4>;
	clocks = <&clks S32V234_CLK_SYS6>;
	clock-names = "stm";
	cpu = <1>;

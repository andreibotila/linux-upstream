Fault Collection and Control Unit in S32v234 or S32-Gen1 Soc

This is a module, it used to collect and control fault signals from
peripherals. It requires a correct configuration to enable reception and react
to a signal from a channel.

After it is configured successfully, a reset signal from a configured channel can
reset system. If a signal is generated before FCCU is configured, the signal
will be ignored.

Required properties:
 - compatible: 		should be set to "fsl,s32v234-fccu" or "fsl,s32gen1-fccu"
 - nxp,ncf_fault_off:	array of faults for NCF_Sn registers
 - reg:				the address range

Any driver requiring access to FCCU registers should reference it from its own
device tree node.

Example:

fccu: fccu@400B0000 {
				compatible = "fsl,s32v234-fccu";
				reg = <0x400B0000 0x1000>;
				clocks = <&clks S32V234_CLK_SYS6>;
				clock-names = "fccu";
				nxp,ncf_fault_off = <35 36 37 38>;
				status = "disabled";
			};

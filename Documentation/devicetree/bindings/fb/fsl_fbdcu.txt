* Freescale Display Control Unit (DCU)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,s32v234-dcu".
- reg: Address and length of the register set for DCU.
- interrupts: Should contain DCU interrupts.
- clocks: From common clock binding: handle to DCU clock.
- clock-names: From common clock binding: Shall be "dcu".
- memory-region : The phandle to the reserved memory region.

Examples:

#include <dt-bindings/clock/s32v234-clock.h>

dcu0: dcu@40028000 {
	compatible = "fsl,s32v234-dcu";
	reg = <0x40028000 0x5000>;
	interrupts = <0 95 4>;
	clocks = <&clks S32V234_CLK_DCU_AXI>,
		 <&clks S32V234_CLK_DCU_PIX>;
	clock-names = "dcu", "ipg";
	memory-region = <&dcu_surface_memory>;
	status = "disabled";
};

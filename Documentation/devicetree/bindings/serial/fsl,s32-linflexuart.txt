* Freescale LINFlexD UART

The LINFlexD controller implements several LIN protocol versions, as well as
support for full-duplex UART communication through 8-bit and 9-bit frames. The
Linflex UART driver enables operation only in UART mode.

See chapter 47 ("LINFlexD") in the reference manual[1].

Required properties:
- compatible :
  - "fsl,s32-linflexuart" for linflex configured in uart mode which
  is compatible with the one integrated on S32V234 SoC
- reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts : Should contain uart interrupt
- clocks : phandle + clock specifier pairs, one for each entry in clock-names
- clock-names : should contain: "lin" - the uart clock

Example:
#include <dt-bindings/clock/s32gen1-scmi-clock.h>

uart0: serial@401C8000 {
	compatible = "fsl,s32-linflexuart";
	reg = <0x401C8000 0x3000>;
	interrupts = <0 82 1>;
	clocks = <&clks S32GEN1_SCMI_CLK_LINFLEX_LIN>,
		 <&clks S32GEN1_SCMI_CLK_LINFLEX_XBAR>;
	clock-names = "lin", "ipg";
	dmas = <&edma0 0 4>,
	       <&edma0 0 3>;
	dma-names = "rx", "tx";
};

};

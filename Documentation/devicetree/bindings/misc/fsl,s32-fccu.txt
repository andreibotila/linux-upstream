Fault Collection and Control Unit in S32v234 or S32-Gen1 Soc

This is a module, it used to collect and control fault signals from
peripherals. It requires a correct configuration to enable reception and react
to a signal from a channel.

After it is configured successfully, a reset signal from a configured channel can
reset system. If a signal is generated before FCCU is configured, the signal
will be ignored.

Required properties:
 - compatible: 		should be set to "fsl,s32v234-fccu" or "fsl,s32gen1-fccu"
 - nxp,ncf_fault_list:	array of faults for NCF_Sn registers
 - reg:				the address range
 - interrupt-names:
	- "fccu_alarm"
	- "fccu_misc"
 - interrupts:
	- fccu alarm state interrupt
	- fccu misc interrupt (configuration timeout)

Optional properties:
 - nxp,ncf_actions : Array of actions for NCF. Available actions are defined in
		     dt-bindings/misc/s32-fccu.h. One can select multiple actions
		     using '|' operator.

Any driver requiring access to FCCU registers should reference it from its own
device tree node.

Example:
    #include <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h>
    #include <dt-bindings/clock/s32v234-clock.h>
    #include <dt-bindings/misc/s32-fccu.h>

    fccu@400B0000 {
      compatible = "fsl,s32v234-fccu";
      reg = <0x400B0000 0x1000>;
      interrupts = <0 100 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
                  <0 101 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
      interrupt-names = "fccu_alarm",
                        "fccu_misc";
      clocks = <&clks S32V234_CLK_SYS6>;
      clock-names = "fccu";
      nxp,ncf_fault_list = <35 36 37 38>;
      nxp,ncf_actions = <S32_FCCU_REACTION_ALARM
                S32_FCCU_REACTION_ALARM
                S32_FCCU_REACTION_ALARM
                S32_FCCU_REACTION_ALARM>;
      status = "disabled";
    };

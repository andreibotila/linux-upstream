NXP STM timer used as universal time source

This STM timer driver is designed to be used as universal time source
for S32 Gen1 SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible : "fsl,s32gen1-stm-global"
- reg : Should contain 1 register range(address and length)
- clocks : stm clock
- clock-names : stm

Optional properties:
- interrupts
- cpu

Example:

#include <dt-bindings/clock/s32gen1-scmi-clock.h>

stm0: stm@4000D000{
	compatible = "fsl,s32gen1-stm-global";
	reg = <0x4000D000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 24 4>;
	clocks = <&clks S32GEN1_SCMI_CLK_STM_MODULE>;
	clock-names = "stm";
	status = "disabled";
	cpu = <2>;
};

&stm0 {
	status = "okay";
};
